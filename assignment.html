In the quiet of the night,
Underneath the pale moonlight,
Dreams take flight, hearts ignite,
Stars above, shining bright.

Whispers of the gentle breeze,
Through the leaves of ancient trees,
Nature's song, a sweet reprise,
Moments like these, bring such ease.

Paths we walk, both near and far,
Guided by a distant star,
Life's a journey, bizarre,
Yet we find who we are.
